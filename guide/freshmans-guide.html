							<div id="jfk" class="sbs-info">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">If you land on JFK</h2>
								<p>This is usually preferred as it is a cheaper alternative and most international airlines service here. 
									Taking taxi is a bad idea, you would want to <a href="https://us.megabus.com/" target="_blank">book a bus ticket from New York to State College</a>.
									(Megabus also offers service from other places such as Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia).</p>
								<p>Take the Airtrain from JFK to Penn Station, you will have to walk for around 15 minutes to get to the Megabus stop.
									The Megabus stop is on the 34th st. between 11th and 12th ave. and you will arrive five hours later at State
									College, PA on the corner of Walmart Parking Lot (1665 North Atherton st.)</p>
								<p>From Walmart, take V or NV bus (you will see the bus stop closest to Walmart and <span style="color:#040040; font-weight:700;">not</span> the one close to McDonalds) to
									campus or downtown. Note that <span style="color:#040040;font-weight:700;">they only take cash</span> of 2.00 USD!</p>
								<p>Feel free to contact any of our officers if you are not sure where you are going.</p>

								<h1 style="text-align: center;">How to get around campus?</h1>
								<p>The University Park campus is very big, so make sure that you are not lost going to your classes!
									The map of campus can be found <a href="https://map.psu.edu/?id=1134#!ct/33177,25403,26748,26749,26750,27255" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
								<p>To commute from place to place within campus, there are bus services on campus provided by <a href="https://catabus.com/">CATA</a>. 
									The loops and the links are free, the others charge 2.00 USD. The CATA buses not only can take you around campus, but also to places far from campus (for example, take V bus to Walmart and M bus to Nittany Mall).</p>
								<p>Having a CATA App on your phone is extremely useful to see the schedule and stops of the bus you are taking.</p>
								<p>â€‹If you prefer to bike around campus, make sure your bike is registered either with the <a href="http://www.statecollegepa.us/999/Bike-Ordinances" target="_blank">Borough of State College</a> or the <a href="https://transportation.psu.edu/rules-regulations" target="_blank">Penn State Parking Office</a>.</p>

							<div class="live-desc">
								<p>There are many places provided for international students to live in. Unfortunately, 
									first year students are limited only to the dorms on campus.The five dorm complexes are: East, North, South, West, and Pollock Halls</p>
								<p>Housing can be accessed through eLiving (eLiving.psu.edu), you can choose your dorm and even your roommate!
									You can see the housing Penn State provides <a href="https://housing.psu.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<div class="hall-container">
									<div class="east-south-west two-line">
										<div class="grid divide-three">
											<div class="grid-element ">
												<h2>East</h2>
												<p>This is the most popular placement for freshmen, making it very lively. 
													If you are one of the more "excited" students, this is a good place to meet new people and to make friends. 
													Be cautious, though, this complex is not close to classes and is always crowded on Friday nights so if you're the studying-in-a-quiet-place type, East Halls might not be the best choice for you.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="grid divide-three">
											<div class="grid-element">
												<h2>South</h2>
												<p>This is a beautiful part of campus that includes renovated halls and it is known for being clean and tidy. 
													There is not many freshmen living here and it is not very far from campus but closer to the downtown area. 
													Sorority suites are placed here, but only on certain dorms. If you are looking for nicer facilities, South Halls might be the right one for you.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="grid divide-three">
											<div class="grid-element">
												<h2>West</h2>
												<p>Although most of the residents are upperclassmen, everyone in Penn State recognizes its beauty. 
													Here, you will find beautiful brick buildings that lead to the heart of campus. 
													It is very close to the HUB and it is right next to the library. 
													The famous cookies of Penn State is most commonly found in West Halls! Many engineering and science students reside here because their classes are close. If you prefer a quiet place with convenient location, West Halls is a really good option.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="north-pollock two-line">
										<div class="grid divide-two">
											<div class="grid-element">
												<h2>North</h2>
												<p>This is a very good place for studying because it is always quiet, and it is only five minutes away from the library and ten to the HUB! 
													Each suite has its own bathroom, which is pretty luxurious for college students. 
													To top it off, dorms are carpeted, and the air conditioning and heater is all controlled within each room. 
													If you are considering any business major, North Halls might be a really good choice since it is very close to the business building. What has to be noted, though, is that it is pretty far from other places on campus.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="grid divide-two">
											<div class="grid-element">
												<h2>Pollock</h2>
												<p>This is a good option for incoming freshmen who are looking for friends their age. 
													It is one of the halls with the friendliest atmosphere with many international students living in. 
													It is closer to campus than south, east, and north halls. 
													It also offers a more interesting and enjoyable dining experience compared to the others. Pollock Halls might be a good option if you are looking for new friends and a good location.</p>
